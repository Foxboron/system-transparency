## Configs

Directories for individual operating-system configuration can be created here. These directories must at least contain a 'stconfig.json' file. The corresponding files like OS-kernel, OS-initramfs, etc. can be included as well. After utilizing the _stconfig tool_ 'stboot.ball' is saved there as well.
See http://doc.system-transparency.org for further information about 'stconfig.json' and 'stboot.ball'

The _debian_ system included in this repository will create its configuration directory here automatically during the setup.
